<h3>The importance of having side projects even after landing your first dev job.</h3>

<p>
    During my web dev boot camp, my instructor repeated a useful mantra: “Always be coding,” or “ABC.” This has been a useful state of mind to keep ever since. The essence of this strategy is to continually learn and develop your skills. The benefit is obvious for a new developer seeking a job, but what about after that developer lands his or her first one? Continually playing with code will be important throughout a developer’s career whether it be new languages, tools, libraries, or strategies - any of which may come up in a future interview. Not only will you be knowledgeable about these potentially applicable subjects, but it will show that you are passionate about coding. Heck, you might even have some fun along the way. The following is a list of all the reasons to keep a side project.
</p>
<p>
    What does it mean to “Always be coding?” For those of us who thrive on specific requirements, this means coding every single day. The instructor who introduced me to this concept prescribed 30 minutes a day, even after landing a job. For me, this has meant to always have some sort of side project in the works. Ideally, I’ll make money from one eventually, but the spirit of this practice is not to make money, but to keep maintaining one’s skills.

<h4>Learning new things</h4>

<p>
    In the two years since I changed careers from engineering to coding full time, I’ve built chat bots and a chat room, native android applications, and now I’m starting this blog! Even this small subset  of the possible projects you can have had exposed me to a multitude of concepts, libraries, and tools in addition to keeping my JavaScript skills up to snuff. 
</p>

<h4>
    It’s fun!
</h4>

<p>I’ve found this to be most prevalent in my chatbot projects. These have a high degree of visibility to my online gaming community, meaning I get a lot of good feedback from people I trust. I can incorporate this feedback into my work and iterate quickly, without the risk of offending "the business." Especially with discord, there are many libraries to choose from to build upon, and a lot of the hard work is done, leaving you the fun part. I made a bot for my server specifically to rick roll my friends, and it was worth every second.</p>

<h4>Money???</h4>

<p>The primary goal of your side projects could start with money in mind, and having a large presence online in the form of a diverse set of niches is the best way to do that. However, even if you're just doing it for the fun and practice, you might find that you make some money eventually, anyway. You might even have other motivations, like providing a useful tool to a community you care for. If you succeed, slap some ads on there! You deserve it.</p>

<h4>Interesting topics in job interviews</h4>

<p>
    The most important aspect, and the purpose for writing this post, is the opportunity to impress on potential future employers that you are serious about programming. I’ve talked about my side projects in every single job interview I’ve had in this field. This part of a programmer’s resume is not just a box to be checked, but the highlight of what makes them attractive to an employer. When asked about certain concepts, you will be able to draw from a larger, more diverse pool of experience than if you only code at work. Better yet, if you create a site that actually gets traffic, you will be able to claim success outside of just messing around in your free time.

<p>Don't be afraid to do something new and exciting! Maybe mess around with a new front end framework, or perhaps create a chat room like I did. Maybe create a chat bot, or a twitter bot, or an archive bot. Maybe you just want to create a custom home page for yourself that nobody else will ever see. Whatever you do, remember, Always Be Coding.</p>
